  Scenario Outline: display the banner on the home page from the same country
    Given I am a new, authenticated admin
    Given that I am on the home page
	When I visit the "/<country>/banners" page
	And I follow "Nuevo banner"
	When I attach the file "features/support/picture.jpg" to "Imagen"
	And I press "Guardar"
	Then I should see "Banner guardado correctamente."
	And I should see the image "picture.png"
